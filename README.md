# External Armory

An Armory implementation for self-hosted Sliver Armories.

### Setup

See the [wiki](https://github.com/sliverarmory/external-armory/wiki/Setup) for the latest installation instructions.

### FAQ

#### Is this the same code that the official Sliver Armory uses?

No. The official Sliver Armory is entirely hosted on public GitHub, i.e. none of the official armory's underlying infrastructure is managed by the Sliver authors. However, this model is not viable for private/3rd party armories, and thus this implementation allows you to self-host your own armory.
