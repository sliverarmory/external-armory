# External Armory

A reference implementation for self-hosted private (or 3rd party public) Sliver armories.

### Setup

See the [wiki]() for the latest installation instructions.

### FAQ

#### Is this the same code that the official armory uses?

No, it's not. The official armory is entirely hosted on public GitHub, i.e. none of the official armory's underlying infrastructure is managed by the Sliver authors. However, this model is not viable for private armories, and thus this implementation allows self-hosted private armories, though you could also use it to host 3rd party public armories as well on your own infrastructure.
